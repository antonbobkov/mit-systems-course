foolishness 1
some 1
time 1

but 1
the 1

Tom 1
comforted 1
a 1
little 1
the 1
hope 1
that 1
some 1
window 1
and 1
aware 1
head 1
visions 1
through 1

so 1
that 1
got 1

Well 1

I 1
Presently 1
stepped 1
the 1
and 1
happy 1
in 1
reached 1
the 1
a 1
glorying 1
over 1
Tom 1
which 1
was 1
wellnigh 1
unbearable 1
But 1
s 1
and 1
the 1
dropped 1
and 1
Tom 1
was 1
in 1
In 1
that 1
even 1
and 1
was 1
silent 1
that 1
not 1
a 1
even 1
when 1
came 1
in 1
but 1
asked 1
the 1
and 1
and 1
so 1
in 1
the 1
that 1

Polly 1
paused 1
and 1
Tom 1
But 1
when 1
got 1
again 1
Well 1

a 1
lick 1
I 1
some 1
when 1

So 1
silence 1
and 1
went 1
a 1
troubled 1
Tom 1
in 1
a 1
and 1
that 1
in 1
was 1
on 1
him 1
and 1
was 1
gratified 1
by 1
the 1
it 1
out 1
that 1
a 1
yearning 1
glance 1
fell 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
through 1
a 1
film 1
but 1
refused 1
it 1
and 1
over 1
him 1
little 1
but 1

never 1
never 1
abuse 1

But 1
cold 1
and 1
and 1
sign 1
a 1
little 1
sufferer 1
were 1
at 1
so 1
upon 1
feelings 1
the 1
that 1
swallowing 1
was 1
so 1
like 1

and 1
swam 1
in 1
a 1
blur 1
which 1
when 1
winked 1
